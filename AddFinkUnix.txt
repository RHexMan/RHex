# AddFinkUnix

# Fink is what's known as a package manager.  The mac operating system is built on top of a more primitive system called unix, that provides most of the core functionality.  However, one of the important features of unix is that it is easily extended.  When you want to add some specific unix capability that is not already in place, you simply ask fink for it.  Fink goes to the cloud and finds what you want and installs it on your machine.  For the RHex project, we need two open source, public domain utilities, gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/) that handles plotting for us, and the GNU Scientific Library (GSL, https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html) that provides the ordinary differential equations (ODE) solver that is at the heart of our swinging and casting simulations.  The steps below install gnuplot and GSL.

# If you have not yet installed Command Line Tools, do so now. Launch the mac Terminal application (in the Computer/Applications/Utilities folder), and at the prompt (some text followed by a $ sign), type:

xcode-select --install

followed by the <return> key.  In general, when you have finished typing a command at the prompt, you must always hit <return> to cause the command to be run.

# If the above command works, fine.  If not, a message will tell you it needs the tools, do you want to download them.  Say yes, and follow subsequent instructions.  If successful, the tools will be in /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/.


# Go online http://www.finkproject.org/download/index.php?phpLang=en to read about Fink and download it.  For mac, select Fink 0.9.0 Binary Installer (Intel).

# At the end of the installation, the pathsetup utility will be launched. You will be asked for permission before your shell's configuration files are edited. When the utility has finished, you are set to go!

# If anything goes wrong during this process, you can try again from the Terminal window by typing at the prompt:
/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh

# (This step should also be repeated by any other users on your system: each user must run pathsetup in his or her own account.) 

# If you have not previously opened a Terminal window, do so now. During the following steps, lots of output will be printed.  You can ignore almost all of it.  Sometimes the output will stop at text that is obviously a question to you.  One of the questions will ask you to enter your Admin password.  Do so, and hit return.  For other questions, you may simply hit return, the default option will be taken, and the command will resume.  Typically there is also a time-out statement, so that if you do nothing for some number of seconds, the default option will be used, and the command will resume automatically.  When commands are done doing whatever they do, you will see the $ prompt again.  Often you need to be quite patient.

# Type at the prompt:
fink scanpackages

# Then type:
fink self-update

# At this point, fink is installed.  Now we use fink to install gnuplot and GSL. Type:
fink install gnuplot

# And finally, type:
fink install gsl
