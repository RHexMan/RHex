# Edit the file ~/.bash_profile to include these lines.  You need not include any line beginning with a #.

source ~/.bashrc

# ?? test -r /sw/bin/init.sh && . /sw/bin/init.sh

# Finds gnuplot.  Actually this will have been done during fink install for the main user, but other users are required to run /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh themselves, which will have the effect of adding the next line:
export PATH=/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:$PATH

# Must have been put in during Fink install:
export PERL5LIB=/sw/lib/perl5:/sw/lib/perl5/darwin

# Finds gsl library headers, which lets the library be used:
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/sw/include
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/sw/include
