Identifier:	CattanachSirD7ft4wt-DZ
	# This is Darryl Hayashida's modification of the Cattanch7ft4wt.  It adds 0.002 to the 5, 10, and 15 inch stations, to lower the stress curve a little.  The specs below are from Dan Zimmerlin's rod that was used in the casting video of 8/11/2014.

# 11/5/2017.  I measured the stretch in the painted 4 wt line used in the video.  For the tip 12’, the stretch was 13” under a 2Kg (=70.6 oz) load.  This was short term sort of equilibrium, as the line tends to continue to stretch if the load is maintained.  At a nominal line core diam = 0.02” (I’m assuming all of the K comes from the core), this would imply line elastic modulus = 1.52e5 psi.  The code doesn’t use the core diam and EM separately, only their product, so these numbers should produce correct results.
