RichGSL Log

In RHex_XS, keep copies of rc_ode_solve.c, rc_ode_solve.h, and RichGSL.t here.
h2xs -Afn RichGSL

OK to have return and y in .c be AV*, but not in .h (see below).
move .c,.h into RichGSL
h2xs -Oxan RichGSL rc_ode_solve.h -L/sw/lib -lgsl

Generates the .xs, making its best guess based on the .h.  Adds the libraries and some constant(?) manipulation code to Makefile.PL.

This is all truly weird.  If I put the perl include in, and run the above, I get lots of problems.  Someplace I saw a warning that  some xs necessary bug prohibits #includes in the .h.

If I take the includes out, and use AV* as the return in rc_ode_solver.h, of course, it fails.  I stumbled on making the return void*, double* y, no includes, and then using the above h2xs.  This makes a good .xs, except, of course, the return is void*, and y is double*.  Edit the file to change the return and y to AV*.

Continuing,
cd RichGSL
perl Makefile.PL
is ok.

If I then, go back and put #include "EXTERN.h" and
#include "perl.h" back in the rc_ode_solver.h, and replace the return void* by AV*, then

make perl

works! On success, renames RichGSL.xsc to RichGSL.c.
