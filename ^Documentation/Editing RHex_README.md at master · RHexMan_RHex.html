# RHex Fly fishing related dynamic simulations. Rich Miller, 19
February, 2019 The RHex project was created to make realistic dynamic
computer simulations of interest to both fly fishers and fly rod
builders. It was preceded by the static Hexrod project of Wayne
Cattanach, which was itself is a computer updating in BASIC of the
historical hand calculations of Garrison (see "A Master's Guide to
Building a Bamboo Fly Rod", Everett Garrison and Hoagy B. Carmichael,
first published in 1977). Frank Stetzer translated Cattanach's code into
CGI/Perl in 1997, and continues to maintain and upgrade it
(www.hexrod.net). In its current form, RHex is written in PERL with
heavy use of PDL and comprises two main programs, RHexCast and
RHexSwing3D. These programs allow very detailed user specification of
the components. The first simulates a complete aerial fly cast in a
vertical plane, following motion of the rod, line, leader, tippet and
fly caused by a user-specified motion of the rod handle. The second
simulates, in full 3D, the motion of the line, leader, tippet and fly,
both in moving water and in still air, caused by a user-specified motion
of the rod tip. This simulation speaks to the common fishing technique
of swinging streamers, but also is applicable to the drifting of nymphs.
Each program has a graphical interface that allows setting, saving, and
retrieving of complex parameter sets, as well as running the simulations
and saving the results, both as pictures and as text.
