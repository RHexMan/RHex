In Terminal:

# Get to where the code is:
cd /Users/richmiller/Active/Code/PERL/RHexrod/Current

# To package RHexStatic.pl into the executable RHexStatic.  The --compile flag is necessary for pp to record stuff loaded at runtime:
pp -o RHexStatic --compile RHexStatic.pl

# To run it, simply double-click in the Finder or from Terminal execute:
./RHexStatic.pl

# A few "use" modules were not found because they were autoloaded at runtime.  Simply "use" them explicitly.

# Try to package RHexCast:
pp -o RHexCast --compile RHexCast.pl

# And finally:
pp -o RHexReplot --compile RHexReplot.pl


# These all can be bundled together, and executed singly with link (ln, so make alias?).
pp -o RHex --compile RHexCast.pl RHexReplot.pl RHexStatic.pl

ln RHex RHexStatic
ln RHex RHexCast
ln RHex RHexReplot

# Which will make hard aliases in the same folder.  Just double click each in Finder, or ./XX in Terminal to run.


# Other projects:
pp -o RSink --compile RSink.pl
