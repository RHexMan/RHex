# Weights and Diameters each foot, white space separated without newlines, starting with the tip end. Trailing zeros may be added to improve tab appearance. The specific gravity of the material is ignored if both weights and diameters are given.  If elastic and/or damping moduli are given, they override the default values for the material.

# Measurements on 10/11/2019 on the first 10ft of the painted video line gave the following results:  Suspended vertically with a 1076gm (16554 grain) weight on the fly end.  Let the weight hang for a minute, then repeatedly dropped it from the just taut position to find the weighted position and (approximately) count the number of cycles of observable oscillation.  Limiting values were reached after a small number of drops.  The limiting just taut delta over nominal was 3.9cm and the weighted delta was 21.3cm.  Thus the weighted strain was 17.4/308.7. Damping was severe, perhaps 4 cycles to equilibrium.

# Found moduli from an RHexCast3D simulation.  Remember that for non-uniform line, you need a lot of segments.  With 20 segments, the numbers below give the measured final stretch of 17.4cm.  Note that only the product of the elastic modulus and the core area comes into the calculation.  I didn't measure the area, but adjusted it to get the limiting stretch, keeping the elastic modulus at a standard mono number.

# The damping modulus value should be thought of as quite rough an approximation.

# Nominal 4 wt.

ElasticModulus:	2.1e5
# It is quite conceivable that the tapered leaders are not the same material as the tippet.
