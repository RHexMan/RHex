# Weights and Diameters each foot, white space separated without newlines, starting with the tip end. Trailing zeros may be added to improve tab appearance. The specific gravity of the material is ignored if both weights and diameters are given.  If elastic and/or damping moduli are given, they override the default values for the material.

# Measurements on 10/10/2019 on Umpqua 10ft 3X Nylon tapered leader gave the following results:  First, the actual leader length was 10' 11" (333cm).  Suspended vertically with a 326gm (5015 grain) weight on the fly end.  Let the weight hang for a minute, then repeatedly dropped it from the just taut position to find the weighted position and (approximately) count the number of cycles of observable oscillation.  Limiting values were reached after a small number of drops.  The limiting just taut delta over nominal was 1.5cm and the weighted delta was 10.2cm.  Thus the weighted strain was 8.7/334.5. Damping was very severe, perhaps 2-3 cycles to equilibrium.

# I tried the moduli (3.15e5,1e4) from the 3x umpqua level mono here.  Remember that for tapered leader, you need a lot of line segments.  With 20 segments, the numbers from the Umpqua 3x mono tippet give a limiting stretch of 6.98, less than the measured 8.7 cm.  Adjusting to EM = 2.45e5 simulates to a final stretch of 8.75 cm.

# It is quite conceivable that the tapered leaders are not the same material as the tippet.
