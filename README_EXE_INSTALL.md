### RHex-0.1.0 - INSTRUCTIONS FOR FINISHING INSTALLATION OF THE EXECUTABLE VERSION OF RHex for the MAC

2 May, 2019

If you found this README\_EXE\_INSTALL you have already unzipped the distribution.  In the same folder as this file there is also a file named RHex_INSTALL.sh.  Simply double click on it and it will create three new files, RHexSwing3D, RHexCast3D, and RHexReplot3D.  It will also open a Mac Terminal window and write some text to it.  When you see the line: `[Process completed]` you can close the window.  The three new files are the RHex executables.  Double click on them to start them running.

At this point you should read the first part of the README.md file also included in the unzipped folder, which is a complete introduction to RHex.
